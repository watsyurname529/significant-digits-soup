# significant-digits-soup
A python and beautifulsoup based web scraper to extract the significant digits from FiveThirtyEight's Significant Digits daily article.

In addition to the web scraper, also present are scripts to both manage and plot the resulting data.

This project has now become a venue for me to try different things, which is partly responsible for having different languages and different implementations of the same thing.
